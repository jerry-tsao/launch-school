3. Without running this code, what will it print? Why?

dict1 = {
    "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy": 42,
    'Monty Python': 'The Life of Brian',
    'Airplane!': "Don't call me Shirley!",
}

dict2 = dict(dict1)
dict2['Monty Python'] = 'Holy Grail'
print(dict1['Monty Python'])


The code will print 'The Life of Brian'. The line "dict2 = dict(dict1)" creates
a new dictionary. Even though the initial key/value pairs are the same, dict1
and dict2 are referencing different dictionaries, so changing a value in dict2
does not affect dict1.
