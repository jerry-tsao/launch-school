4. Without running this code, what will it print? Why?

dict1 = {
    'a': [1, 2, 3],
    'b': (4, 5, 6),
}

dict2 = dict(dict1)
dict1['a'][1] = 42
print(dict2['a'])


The code will print [1, 42, 3]. Even though the line "dict2 = dict(dict1)"
creates a new dictionary with the same key/value pairs as dict1, both
dictionaries have the same reference to the same object [1, 2, 3] as the copy
is shallow.
