10. Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order.
Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)


The names will probably not print in alphabetical order. Sets do not preserve
the order of their elements.
