9.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]]
another_list = list(my_list)

Given the above code, answer the following questions and explain your answers:

1. Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list equal?
2. Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list the same object?
3. Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list equal?
4. Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list the same object?

Don't write any code for this exercise.


1. The lists assigned to my_list and another_list are equal. They have the same
elements.
2. The lists assigned to my_list and another_list are not the same object as the
list constructor creates a new object.
3. The nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list are equal. They have
the same elements.
4. The nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list are the same object
as the list constructor creates a shallow copy.
