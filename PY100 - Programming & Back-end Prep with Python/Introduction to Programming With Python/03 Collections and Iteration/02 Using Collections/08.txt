8. Explain why the code below prints different values on lines 3 and 4.

text = "It's probably pining for the fjords!"

print(text[21:35].rfind('f'))     # 8
print(text.rfind('f', 21, 35))    # 29


In the first print statement, "rfind" is operating on a new string created by
slicing text. The first "f" character occurs at index 8 of the new string. In
the second print statement, "rfind" is operating on the existing "text" string,
but it is starting the search at index 21. Therefore, it finds the first
occurence of "f" at index 29 of the existing "text" string.
