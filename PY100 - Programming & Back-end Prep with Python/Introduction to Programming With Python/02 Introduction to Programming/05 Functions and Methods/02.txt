2. Take a look at this code snippet:

foo = 'bar'

def set_foo():
    foo = 'qux'

set_foo()
print(foo)

What does this program print? Why?


The program will print "bar". The line "foo = 'qux'" inside the set_foo()
function creates a local variable "foo", which does not affect the global
"foo" initialized in line 1.
