1. What happens when you run the following program? Why do we get that result?

def set_foo():
    foo = 'bar'

set_foo()
print(foo)


We will get an error. "foo" is a local variable in the "set_foo()" function, so
the print statement at the end of the code is unable to access it. It is out of
scope.
