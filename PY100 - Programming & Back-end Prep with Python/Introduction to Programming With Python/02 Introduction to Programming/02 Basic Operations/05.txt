5. Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index
greater than or equal to the list's length? For example:

foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(foo[3])      # will this result in an error?


Yes, it will result in an "IndexError" error as the index is out of range. The
index must be within the range of the length of the list minus one.
