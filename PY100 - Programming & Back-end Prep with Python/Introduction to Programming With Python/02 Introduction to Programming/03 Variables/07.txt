7. What happens when you run the following code? Why?

NAME = 'Victor'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

NAME = 'Nina'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)


Victor will be greeted three times, and then Nina will be greeted three times.
Even though "NAME" is in all uppercase letters, Python does not treat constants
any differently than variables. Therefore, reassigning "NAME" from "Victor" to
"Nina" is valid in Python.
