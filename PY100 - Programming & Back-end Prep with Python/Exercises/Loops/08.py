'''
And on and on and on

The following code keeps looping forever. (You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.) Why
does the loop keep running? Modify it so that it stops after the first
iteration.

while True:
    print("and on")
'''


# The code will keep looping forever because the while loop is always true.

while True:
    print("and on")
    break
