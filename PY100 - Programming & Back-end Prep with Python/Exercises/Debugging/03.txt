Multiply By Five

When the user inputs 10, we expect the program to print The result is 50!, but
that's not the output we see. Why not?

def multiply_by_five(n):
    return n * 5

print("Hello! Which number would you like to multiply by 5?")
number = input()

print(f"The result is {multiply_by_five(number)}!")


The output we see is "The result is 1010101010!". The input needs to be
converted to an integer for the program to work as we expect.
