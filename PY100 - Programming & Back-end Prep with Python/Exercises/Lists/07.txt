Equality

Predict the output of the code shown below. When you run the code, do you see
what you expected? Why or why not?

list1 = [2, 6, 4]
list2 = [2, 6, 4]

print(list1 == list2)


Predicted output: True

The output (True) is what I expected as the equality operator compares objects
based on their values.
