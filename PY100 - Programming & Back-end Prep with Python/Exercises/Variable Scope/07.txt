What's my value? (Part 7)

What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to
answer.

a = 1

def my_function():
    global a
    a = 2

my_function()
print(a)


The code will print 2. The line "global a" tells my_function() to access the
"a" variable that was initialized in the first line as opposed to creating a new
local variable.
