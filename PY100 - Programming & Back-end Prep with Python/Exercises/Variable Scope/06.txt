What's my value? (Part 6)

What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to
answer.

a = 1

def my_function():
    a = 2

my_function()
print(a)


The code will print 1. The variable "a" insde my_function() is local and does
not affect the value of the "a" outside the function definition.
