What's my value? (Part 5)

What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to
answer.

a = 1

def my_function():
    print(a)
    a = 2

my_function()


The code will throw an error. Since the variable "a" is assigned inside
my_function() an thus a local variable, it cannot be printed before its value
is assigned.
