What's my value? (Part 9)

What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to
answer.

a = 7

def my_function(b):
    b += 10

my_function(a)
print(a)


The code will print 7. In the function call, the value of "a" is passed to
my_function. It creates a local variable "b", which ends up with the value 17.
However, the global variable "a" does not get modified.
