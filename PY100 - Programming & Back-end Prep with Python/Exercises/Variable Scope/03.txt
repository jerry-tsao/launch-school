What's my value? (Part 3)

What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to
answer.

def my_function():
    a = 1

    if True:
        print(a)

my_function()


The code will print 1. The variable "a" is initialized insde my_function. The
if statement will always be true, so it will print 1.
