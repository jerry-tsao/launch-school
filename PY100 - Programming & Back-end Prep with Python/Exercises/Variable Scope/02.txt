What's my value? (Part 2)

What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to
answer.

x = 10

def my_function():
    x = x + 5
    print(x)

my_function()


The code will raise an error. Inside my_function, the assignment statement
causes Python to assume that the variable "x" is local, so it cannot be used
without first being initialized.
