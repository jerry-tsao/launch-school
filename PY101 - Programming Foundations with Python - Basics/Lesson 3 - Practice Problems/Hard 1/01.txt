def first():
    return {
        'prop1': "hi there",
    }

def second():
    return
    {
        'prop1': "hi there",
    }

print(first())
print(second())


The two functions return different results. first() returns the dictionary, as
expected. second() returns None since there is nothing else on the same line
after return.
